How to Use a Virtual Phone Number to Register on Facebook:

With over 2.8 billion active users, Facebook has become a key platform for social networking and communication. To sign up for the service, providing a phone number is required to confirm your identity. However, many individuals wish to maintain privacy and control over whom they share their personal phone numbers with. Virtual phone numbers offer the perfect solution for verifying your Facebook account without compromising security.

Defining Virtual Phone Numbers:

A virtual phone number, also referred to as a disposable or temporary number enables you to receive SMS/OTP messages or phone calls just like a regular phone number. But unlike a permanent number tied to your mobile carrier, a virtual number is acquired through apps or online services. After obtaining access, the virtual number can be used for verification purposes such as registering social media accounts or online shopping profiles.
